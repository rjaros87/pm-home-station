# Home use particulate matter sensor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rjaros87/pm-home-station.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rjaros87/pm-home-station)

Since we live in big polluted cities the air quality is on a very poor level. But, the problem is not only connected to the big cities - even smaller cities and villages may suffer from air pollution.
That's why we've created this little project to let you build your own Particulate Matter monitoring station and use our open-source software so you could monitor the air quality in your place of living.

Let's live healthier life and start measuring the air quality and filtering it if necessary.

## Assemble the PM sensor

### USB version

1. Connect the PlanTower device with ICD10 adapter (~~like on photo below~~). 
> Caution! The pins on the PlanTower device are located in the top right corner. Numeration starts from the right top corner (1) and ends in the left bottom corner (10). 

2. Connect IDC10 adapter (bigger pins :smile:) to the UART-USB adapter. Wire connections are presented in a table below
> Caution! The adapter must have a separate VCC pin for 5V or a switch between 3.3V and 5V since the PlanTower device works on 5V voltage.

ICD10 adapter | UART-USB adapter
------------- | ----------------
VCC (5V)      | VCC (5V)
GND           | GND
RX            | TXD
TXD           | RXD

3. Connect the UART-USB adapter with a USB cable to your computer
> Caution! Refer to [this](#tested-platforms) section for remarks regarding your platform

4. Start the application and check the air quality of your environment :smile:

### Bluetooth version

1. Follow 1-3 steps of USB instruction above, but use your Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE module instead of UART-USB adapter

2. Cut off any old USB cable

3. Connect the power (5V) from USB cable or socket to Vcc and GND (2 most outside pins of USB plug, usually red 5V cable and black GND). You may need to shortcircuit data pin/wires (2 center pins) or connect them via ~200ohm resistor in order to be recognized by charger. Details can be found [here](http://pinouts.ru/Slots/USB_pinout.shtml "USB pinout").

## 3D printed enclosure

- 4x M3 x 25 machine screws with nuts are required to assemble the enclosure

- [Top v3 with hidden screws](/3d_models/top_v3_hidden_screws.stl)
- [Bottom v3 with hidden screws](/3d_models/bottom_v3_hidden_screws.stl)

or

- [Top v1](/3d_models/top_v1.stl)
- [Bottom v1](/3d_models/bottom_v1.stl)

or for FT232 usb-uart adapter

- [Top v4 with hidden screws for FT232 usb-uart adapter](/3d_models/top_v4_hidden_screws_ft232_adapter.stl)
- [Bottom v3 with hidden screws](/3d_models/bottom_v3_hidden_screws.stl)


Suggested printing parameters:
- Infill: 20%
- Resolution: 0.2
- Supports: No

> Caution! Make sure the soldered ends of the USB-UART pins (at the bottom of the adapter) are properly insulated from the sensor's metal case! Some adapters have them so long that they become too close to the sensor and may short-circuit the adapter. It's best to sand them off and use insulation tape.
